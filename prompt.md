An Administrator would  like  his Factory Manager  to enter utility and expense  information on an online form. For each utility such as electricity, water, Internet and consumables items  entries must be made of usage. The Factory Manager must also use his mobile device to take a picture of the utility meter or bill to be placed on the form. This must be done on a daily basis if necessary but can be done at anytime as long as the period is noted. Can you give me HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for the form. The form must be responsive, accessible, interactive and attractive. When the factory manager clicks the submit button the form should be sent to the Administrators email address using form spree.
